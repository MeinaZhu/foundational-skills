The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts:

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will complete a few R exercises that demonstrates your ability to apply the first phases of the LA workflow and data wrangling techniques introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies learning analytics analysis to an educational context or topic of interest. More specifically, **locate a study that makes use of the Learning Analytics Workflow we learned today.** You are also welcome to select one of your research papers.

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   Nawaz, S., Kennedy, G., Bailey, J., & Mead, C. (2020). Moments of Confusion in Simulation-Based Learning Environments. *Journal of Learning Analytics*, *7*(3), 118-137.

2.  What educational issue, "problem of practice," and/or questions were addressed?

    -   Students' confusion in simulation-based learning environments

3.  Briefly describe any steps of the data-intensive research workflow that detailed in your article or presentation.

    -   Prepare-explore-model-communicate

4.  What were the key findings or conclusions? What value, if any, might education practitioners find in these results?

    -   confidence in prior knowledge is an important factor that can contribute to students\' confusion. Students mostly struggled when they discovered a mismatch between the subjective and objective correctness of their responses.

5.  Finally, how, if at at, were educators in your self-selected article involved prior to wrangling and analysis?

    -   No specific info

Draft a new research question of guided by the the phases of the Learning Analytics Workflow. Or use one of your current research questions.

1.  What educational issue, "problem of practice," and/or questions is addressed??

    -   What strategies improve learners' SDL skills in online learning?

2.  Briefly describe any steps of the data-intensive research workflow that can be detailed in your article or presentation.

    -   Prepare-wrangel-explore-model-communicate

3.  How, if at all, will your article touch upon the application(s) of LA to "understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs?"

    -   Yes.

### Part II: Data Product

In our Learning Analytics code-along, we scratched the surface on the number of ways that we can wrangle the data.

Using one of the data sets provided in the data folder, your goal for this lab is to extend the Learning Analytics Workflow from our code-along by preparing and wrangling different data.

*Or alternatively, you may use your own data set to use in the workflow. If you do decide to use your own data set you must include:*

-   *Show two different ways using `select` function with your data, inspect and save as a new object.*

-   *Show one way to use `filter` function with your data, inspect and save as a new object.*

-   *Show one way using `arrange` function with your data, inspect and save as a new object.*

-   *Use the pipe operator to bring it all together.*

Feel free to create a new script in your lab 2 to work through the following problems. Then when satisfied add the code in the code chunks below. Don;t forget to run the code to make sure it works.

**Instructions:**

1.  *Add* your name to the document in author.

2.  Set up the first (or, two if using an Introduction) phases of the LA workflow below. I've added the wrangle section for you. You will need to `Prepare` the libraries necessary to wrangle the data.

## Wrangle

3.  In the chunk called `read-data`: *Import* the `sci-online-classes.csv` from the `data` folder and *save* as a new `object` called `sci_classes`. Then *inspect* your data using a `function` of your choice.

```{r, read-data}
# Type your code here

library(tidyverse)

sci_classess <- read_csv("data/sci-online-classes.csv")

sci_classess
```

4.  In the select-1 code chunk: Use the 'select' function to *select* `student_id`, `subject`, `semester`, `FinalGradeCEMS`. *Assign* to a new object with a different name (you choose the name).

```{r, select-1}
# Type your code here

new_sci_classess <- sci_classess %>% 
  select("student_id","subject","semester","FinalGradeCEMS")

```

-   

What do you notice about FinalGradeCEMS?(\*Hint: NAs?)

-   Answer here is.na(sci_classess\$FinalGradeCEMS)

5.  In code chunk named `select-2` *select* all columns except `subject` and `section`. *Assign* to a new object with a different name. *Examine* your data frame with a different `function`.

```{r, select-2}
# Type your code here

new2_sci_classess <- sci_classess %>% 
  select(-c("subject","section"))

glimpse(new2_sci_classess)
```

6.  In the code chunk named `filter-1`, *Filter* the **sci_classes data** frame for students in OcnA courses. *Assign* to a new object with a different name. *Use* the head() function to examine your data frame.

```{r, filter-1}
#Type your code here

filter_1 <- sci_classess %>%
  filter ( subject == "OcnA")

head(filter_1)
```

Q: How many rows does the head() function display? *Hint: Check the dimensions of your tibble in the console.*

-   Answer here: 6

7.  In code chunk named `filter-2`, *filter* the **sci_classes data** frame so rows with NA for points earned are removed. *Assign* to a new object with a different name. *Use* glimpse() to examine all columns of your data frame.

```{r, filter 2}
# Type your code here
filter_2 <- sci_classess %>%  
  drop_na(Points_Earned)

head(filter_2)

```

8.  In the code chunk called `arrange-1`, *Arrange* **sci_classes data** by `subject` then `percentage_earned` in descending order. *Assign* to a new object. *Use* the str() function to examine the data type of each column in your data frame.

    ```{r arrange-1}
    sci_classess %>% 
      arrange(desc(subject),desc(percentage_earned))
    #%>%  arrange(desc(percentage_earned))

    ```

9.  In the code chunk name `final-wrangle`, *use* **sci_classes data** data and the %\>% `pipe` operator:

-   Select `student_id`, `subject`, `semester`, `FinalGradeCEMS`.
-   Filter for students in OcnA courses.
-   Arrange grades by section in descending order.
-   Assign to a new object.
-   Examine the contents using a method of your choosing.

```{r}
#Type your code here

final_wrangle <- sci_classess %>%
   select(student_id,subject,semester,FinalGradeCEMS) %>%
   filter(subject=="OcnA") %>%
   arrange(desc(FinalGradeCEMS))
            
glimpse(final_wrangle)
```

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Foundation Badge on Learning Analytics Workflow! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review by

1.  Change the name of the author: in the [YAML header](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/yaml-header.html) at the very top of this document to your name. As noted in [Reproducible Research in R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html), The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Click the yarn icon above to "knit" your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.

3.  Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.

4.  Publish your HTML page the web using one of the following [publishing methods](https://rpubs.com/cathydatascience/518692): Publish on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane when you knit your document. Note, you will need to quickly create a RPubs account. Publishing on GitHub using either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or the [HTML previewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io/).

5.  Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [Foundations Badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/foundations/discussions/2). In your post, include a link to your published web page and `write` a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you'd like to explore further.
